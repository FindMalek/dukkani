## 🌟 Vision

Enable every small and medium Tunisian business to sell online, easily and professionally. We want to make launching an online store as simple as creating an Instagram account — no coding, no complexity, no barriers.

### The Problem

Most Tunisian and North African merchants still rely on physical stores and social media (like Instagram or Facebook) for sales. They lack easy access to affordable e-commerce tools that integrate with local delivery systems and payment gateways. Shopify and WooCommerce are too complicated or expensive for most.

### The Solution

A localized SaaS platform that helps businesses:

- Create a beautiful online store in minutes (with AI-assisted setup)
- Accept payments through local gateways (e.g., D17, Flouci, E-Dinar)
- Manage inventory, delivery, and orders all in one dashboard
- Offer multilingual experiences (Arabic, French, English)
- Seamlessly sync with Instagram or WhatsApp for quick sharing

### Target Market

- Small to medium local stores
- Artisan brands and clothing shops
- Food delivery or grocery shops
- Local resellers and social sellers (Instagram / Facebook merchants)

### Long-Term Vision

To become the **Shopify of North Africa** — starting with Tunisia, then scaling across Francophone and Arabic-speaking markets with localized infrastructure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local database)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FindMalek/dukkani.git
cd dukkani
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project:
```bash
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/dukkani"

# CORS Origin (required for auth)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

4. **Set up the database**

```bash
pnpm run bootstrap
```

This will:
- Start the PostgreSQL database container
- Push the Prisma schema to create all tables

5. **Seed the database (optional)**

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

This creates default users and sample data for development. See [Database Package README](./packages/db/README.md) for details.

6. **Start the development server**

- **Web** (3001): [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) - Marketing/landing site
- **API** (3002): [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) - Backend API
- **Dashboard** (3003): [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) - Merchant dashboard
- **Storefront** (3004): [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004) - Customer-facing store (where shoppers browse and buy)

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Start all apps
pnpm run dev:api          # Start API only
pnpm run dev:dashboard    # Start Dashboard only
pnpm run dev:web          # Start marketing site
pnpm run dev:storefront   # Start storefront (customer store)
pnpm run dev:all          # Start API + Dashboard + Storefront

# Database

pnpm run db:push          # Push schema changes
pnpm run db:seed          # Seed database
pnpm run db:reset-and-seed # Reset and seed

# Code Quality
pnpm run check            # Lint and format
pnpm run check-types      # Type check all packages
pnpm run build            # Build all packages
