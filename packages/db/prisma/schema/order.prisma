/**
 * Represents a customer order placed in a store.
 * Orders contain customer information, delivery address, status tracking, and multiple order items.
 * Each order has a custom ID format: {STORE_PREFIX}-{RANDOM} (e.g., "AHM-abc12345").
 * **Key Fields:**
 * - `id`: Custom string ID with store prefix (e.g., "AHM-abc12345")
 * - `status`: Current order status (PENDING, CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED)
 * - `customerName`: Name of the customer placing the order
 * - `customerPhone`: Contact phone number for the order
 * - `address`: Optional delivery address
 * - `notes`: Optional special instructions or notes
 * - `storeId`: Reference to the Store where the order was placed
 * - `customerId`: Optional reference to a registered Customer (null for guest orders)
 * - `createdAt`: Timestamp when the order was created
 * - `updatedAt`: Timestamp when the order was last updated
 * **Relationships:**
 * - Belongs to one Store
 * - Optionally belongs to one Customer (can be null for guest orders)
 * - Has many OrderItems (products in the order)
 * - Has many WhatsAppMessages (communication history)
 * **Business Logic:**
 * - Orders can be placed by registered customers or guests
 * - When a customer is deleted, their orders remain but customerId is set to null
 * - Order status tracks the fulfillment lifecycle
 * - Custom ID format makes orders URL-friendly and identifiable by store
