 * - `THUMBNAIL`: 150x150px - Used for small previews, thumbnails, and icons
 * - `SMALL`: 400x400px - Used for product grids and list views
 * - `MEDIUM`: 800x800px - Used for product detail pages and gallery views
 * - `LARGE`: 1200x1200px - Used for high-resolution displays and zoom views
 * **Business Logic:**
 * - Variants are generated automatically during image upload processing
 * - Each StorageFile can have one variant of each type
 * - Variants are stored separately to optimize CDN delivery and caching

 * - `STORE_CREATED`: Store has been created with basic information
 * - `STORE_CONFIGURED`: Store theme and category have been configured
 * - `STORE_LAUNCHED`: Onboarding is complete - store is ready for use
 * **Business Logic:**
 * - Default value for new users is `STORE_SETUP`
 * - Steps progress sequentially through the onboarding flow
 * - Used to determine which onboarding page to show and when to redirect to dashboard
 * - Once `STORE_LAUNCHED` is reached, user has full access to the dashboard

 * - Can be `SUSPENDED` if temporarily disabled by admin

 * **Business Logic:**
 * - Each order must have exactly one payment method
 * - Stores can configure which payment methods they support via `supportedPaymentMethods`
 * - Default payment method for new orders is `COD`
 * - Payment method is stored on the order to track fulfillment requirements (e.g., COD orders need cash collection)
